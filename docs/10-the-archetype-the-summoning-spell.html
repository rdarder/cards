<p>You’ve built an incredible “Grand Melee”! It’s a full, chaotic battle
where every card gets a turn, and the logic is smart enough to handle
defeated cards correctly. The game feels more real than ever.</p>
<p>But what happens when the dust settles? A real game doesn’t just end
after one round. The survivors should get ready for the next fight. This
brings up some fascinating new problems that will require some truly
powerful magic to solve.</p>
<h2 data-number="10.2"
id="the-mission-what-well-accomplish-today-8"><span
class="header-section-number">10.2</span> The Mission: What We’ll
Accomplish Today</h2>
<p>Our mission is to build the “post-battle” phase of our game. By the
end of this unit, our program will not only run a full melee, but
also:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Provide a detailed “Damage Report” showing how much health each
surviving card lost.</li>
<li>Gather the surviving cards and prepare a new, fully-healed hand,
ready for the next round.</li>
</ol>

<h2 data-number="10.3" id="quest-a-the-damage-report"><span
class="header-section-number">10.3</span> Quest A: The Damage Report
📜</h2>
<p>Let’s start by making our end-of-round report more interesting.
Instead of just showing a survivor’s remaining health, let’s also show
how much damage they took.</p>
<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Wait, we have a problem. When a card is
attacked, our code does this:
<code>target.life = target.life - attacker.attack</code>. We are
changing the <code>life</code> value directly. By the end of the round,
the original health value is gone forever! How can we possibly calculate
the damage taken if we don’t remember what the health was at the
start?</p>
<p><strong>A New Tactic: Archetypes and Summoned Creatures</strong> To
solve this, we need to think about our cards in a new way. Let’s decide
that from now on, there are two forms of every card:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Archetype:</strong> This is the card’s perfect, original
essence. Its <code>life</code> value is its <strong>maximum</strong>
health. Archetypes are like the master blueprints in a grand
library—they are never changed or damaged.</li>
<li><strong>The Summoned Creature:</strong> When a card is brought into
a battle, it’s a temporary, physical version of its archetype. This is
the version that takes damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we do this, we can always look at a damaged, summoned creature and
compare it to its original archetype to see how much health it has lost.
But that leads to the next question… how do we create a “Summoned
Creature” from an “Archetype”?</p>
<p><strong>The Tool for Summoning: The <code>pairs()</code>
Loop</strong> We need to make a copy. But writing
<code>new_card.name = old_card.name</code>,
<code>new_card.life = old_card.life</code>, etc., for every single stat
is clumsy. What if we add an “armor” stat later? We’d have to remember
to update our copy code.</p>
<p>There’s a better way. We can use a special loop called
<strong><code>for ... in pairs()</code></strong> that automatically
visits every key-value pair in a table, no matter what they’re
named.</p>
<p><strong>Analogy:</strong> Think of a card’s table as a <strong>magic
bag of holding</strong>. <code>pairs()</code> is the spell you use to
pull out every single item from the bag, one by one. For each item, you
get its label (<code>key</code>, e.g., “speed”) and the item itself
(<code>value</code>, e.g., 5).</p>
<p><strong>The Final Piece: Names Point to Things</strong> Before we
build our summoning spell, there’s one crucial idea. When we create our
summoned creature, we need it to remember its original archetype. We’ll
do this by adding a new property:
<code>summoned_creature.archetype = archetype_card</code>. To understand
why this works, think of variables as <strong>names that point to
things</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Analogy:</strong> Imagine a single, real-world object, like a
<strong>cat</strong> 🐈.</p>
<ul>
<li>You and your sibling can both have a name for it:
<code>my_cat</code> and <code>our_pet</code>. Both names point to the
<em>same cat</em>.</li>
<li>If you put a hat on the cat using your name for it
(<code>my_cat.has_hat = true</code>), your sibling sees the change via
their name (<code>our_pet.has_hat</code> is now also <code>true</code>).
You changed the <em>thing</em>.</li>
<li>This is what we’ll do. The <code>summoned_creature.archetype</code>
name will point to the <em>real, original archetype cat</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Let’s build the <code>summon()</code> function!</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Create the function:</strong>
<code>function summon(archetype_card) ... end</code>.</li>
<li><strong>The Body:</strong> Inside, create an empty table for the
<code>summoned_creature</code>. Use a
<code>for key, value in pairs(archetype_card) do ... end</code> loop.
Inside the loop, copy each property:
<code>summoned_creature[key] = value</code>.</li>
<li><strong>The Link:</strong> After the loop, create the link back to
the original:
<code>summoned_creature.archetype = archetype_card</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Return:</strong> <code>return summoned_creature</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Now, update your game!</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Change your <code>cards.lua</code> or card generation list to be the
“Codex of Archetypes.”</li>
<li>When you deal the <code>player_hand</code> and
<code>computer_hand</code>, use your new <code>summon()</code> function
to create summoned creatures for the battle.</li>
<li>Run the Grand Melee logic.</li>
<li>In the Aftermath step, for each <code>survivor</code>, calculate
damage:
<code>local damage_taken = survivor.archetype.life - survivor.life</code>.</li>
<li>Print the new report:
<code>print(survivor.name .. " survived with " .. survivor.life .. " HP (" .. damage_taken .. " damage taken).")</code>.</li>
</ol>

class="header-section-number">10.4</span> Quest B: Preparing for the
Next Round 🔄</h2>
<p>The battle is over, and the damage report is done. What’s next? A new
round! But we can’t send these damaged survivors back into the fight. We
need fresh ones.</p>
<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> We have a list of survivors, but they
are all battle-worn and damaged. How do we prepare a new hand of
fully-healed creatures for the next round?</p>
<p><strong>The Solution:</strong> This is easy now! Since each survivor
has a “shortcut” back to its perfect archetype
(<code>survivor.archetype</code>), we can simply use that archetype to
summon a brand-new, fully-healed copy.</p>
<p><strong>The Task:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>After the “Damage Report” is printed, create a new empty table,
<code>player_hand_for_next_round</code>.</li>
<li>Loop through the (damaged) <code>player_hand</code> from the
battle.</li>
<li>Inside the loop, for each <code>card</code> that survived
(<code>card.life &gt; 0</code>), summon a fresh copy from its archetype:
<code>lua     -- Inside your loop over the survivors...     local fresh_copy = summon(card.archetype)     table.insert(player_hand_for_next_round, fresh_copy)</code></li>
<li>After the loop, print the contents of
<code>player_hand_for_next_round</code> using your
<code>display_card</code> function.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Payoff:</strong> You will see a list of only the
surviving creatures, all restored to their maximum health, proving they
are ready for another fight. This demonstrates the full, powerful
lifecycle: <strong>Archetype -&gt; Summon -&gt; Damage -&gt; Use
Archetype to Re-Summon</strong>.</p>
