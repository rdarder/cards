## Your Quest Begins

You’ve played a ton of games.

You know that awesome feeling when you draw the perfect card, discover a secret, or finally beat that impossible boss.

But what if the game was **yours**? What if *you* designed the epic creatures? What if *you* made the rules?

That's what this is about.

### The Game We'll Build

Imagine a battlefield. Two or more players, each with a custom deck of cards they’ve brought to the fight. Some cards are fierce **characters**—goblins, knights, and dragons. Others are powerful **magic spells** that can heal your creatures or unleash chaos on your opponents.

Cards will clash, life points will drop, and creatures will be defeated in epic combat, until only one player’s army remains on the field. To be the last one standing is victory.

### The Secret Power

Every game you love is built with a secret ingredient: **code**.

Code is the magic that brings worlds to life. It’s the set of instructions that tells the computer how a monster attacks, what a spell does, or which card is the fastest. Learning to code is like learning to be a wizard. It allows you to create things that, before, only existed in your imagination.

### Our Path

Here's the thing about computers: they are incredibly fast and precise, but they need an absolutely perfect recipe to do anything. A simple game rule that we can understand in a minute can be very tricky to explain to a computer. Our quest is to learn how to be expert translators—to turn our game ideas into a perfect set of instructions the computer can follow.

Here’s how we’ll do it:

* **Start Simple, Then Expand:** We’ll take your grand vision and shrink it down to its tiniest, most fun part—like a single creature attacking another. We'll make that one piece work perfectly. Then, we'll add another piece, and another. It might feel like small steps at first, but you'll be amazed at how quickly what you've done before **compounds**, making each new step faster and easier.

* **Brains First, Looks Second:** We'll begin by building the "brain" of the game. We'll make the rules work and the game playable using a simple text interface. Once the core of our game is solid, we'll begin the next phase of our quest: bringing it all to life with **graphics, animations, and sound**.

We will start from scratch and understand every single step we take. You will go from someone who just *plays* games to someone who *makes* them.
